Feature: Foldable versions in master backlog

  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with:
        | name  | ecookbook |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the project uses the following modules:
        | backlogs |
    And there is a role "scrum master"
    And the role "scrum master" may have the following rights:
        | view_master_backlog     |
        | view_taskboards         |
        | update_sprints          |
        | view_wiki_pages         |
        | edit_wiki_pages         |
        | view_work_packages      |
    And the backlogs module is initialized
    And the following types are configured to track stories:
        | Story |
    And the type "Task" is configured to track tasks
    And the project uses the following types:
        | Story |
        | Task  |
    And there is a default status with:
        | name | new |
    And there is a default issuepriority with:
        | name   | Normal |
    And the type "Task" has the default workflow for the role "scrum master"
    And there is 1 user with:
        | login | markus |
        | firstname | Markus |
        | Lastname | Master |
    And the user "markus" is a "scrum master"
    And the project has the following sprints:
        | name       | start_date | effective_date  |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31      |
    And the project has the following stories in the following sprints:
        | subject | sprint     |
        | Story A | Sprint 001 |
        | Story B | Sprint 001 |
        | Story C | Sprint 001 |
    And I am already logged in as "markus"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Version are not folded by default and can be folded
    When I go to the master backlog
    Then I should see "Story A" within ".backlog"

    When I change the fold state of a version
    Then I should not see "Story A" within ".backlog"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Version fold status depends on users setting
    When I go to the my settings page
     And I check "Show versions folded"
     And I submit the form by the "Save" button
    Then I should see "Account was successfully updated"

    When I go to the master backlog
    Then I should not see "Story A" within ".backlog"

    When I change the fold state of a version
    Then I should see "Story A" within ".backlog"

    Then I go to the my settings page
     And I uncheck "Show versions folded"
     And I submit the form by the "Save" button
    Then I should see "Account was successfully updated"

    When I go to the master backlog
    Then I should see "Story A" within ".backlog"

    When I change the fold state of a version
    Then I should not see "Story A" within ".backlog"
