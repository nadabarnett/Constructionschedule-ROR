Feature: Export sprint stories as PDF on the Backlogs view
  As a team member
  I want to export stories as a PDF on the scrum backlogs view
  So that I do not loose context while filling in details

  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with:
        | name  | ecookbook |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the project uses the following modules:
        | backlogs |
    And the following types are configured to track stories:
        | Story |
        | Epic  |
        | Bug   |
    And the type "Task" is configured to track tasks
    And the project uses the following types:
        | Story |
        | Bug   |
        | Task  |
    And there is 1 user with:
        | login | mathias |
    And there is a role "team member"
    And the role "team member" may have the following rights:
        | view_master_backlog   |
        | view_work_packages    |
        | edit_work_packages    |
        | add_work_packages     |
        | manage_subtasks       |
    And the user "mathias" is a "team member"
    And the project has the following sprints:
        | name       | start_date | effective_date |
        | Sprint 001 | 2010-01-01        | 2010-01-31     |
    And there are the following issue status:
        | name        | is_closed  | is_default  |
        | New         | false      | true        |
        | In Progress | false      | false       |
        | Resolved    | false      | false       |
        | Closed      | true       | false       |
        | Rejected    | true       | false       |
    And the type "Story" has the default workflow for the role "team member"
    And there is a default issuepriority with:
        | name   | Normal |
    And the project has the following stories in the following sprints:
        | subject | sprint     | story_points |
        | Story A | Sprint 001 | 10           |
        | Story B | Sprint 001 | 20           |
    And I am already logged in as "mathias"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Export sprint stories as a PDF using the default configuration
    Given there is the single default export card configuration
    And I am on the master backlog
    When I open the "Sprint 001" backlogs menu
    And I follow "Export" of the "Sprint 001" backlogs menu
    Then the PDF download dialog should be displayed
